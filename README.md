# STM32F1 CAN(in)jector - PlatformIO project for STM32F1 development boards (BluePill) for simple CAN testing

This project demonstates how to transmit CAN frames using the STM32F1 family's integrated CAN controller.

It's very much a development tool / working example.

Configured via a debug connection, it allows a CAN frame containing a 64-bit incremental counter to be transmitted at a fixed frame rate.
